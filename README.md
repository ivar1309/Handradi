# ðŸ“¦ HandraÃ°i, a Simple File Storage Server & CLI

A lightweight Go-based file storage service with per-client isolation, API key authentication, and an accompanying CLI for user and file management.  
Designed to integrate easily with [MedusaJS](https://medusajs.com) or be used as a standalone file backend.

## âœ¨ Features

### Server
- **HTTP-based file storage API**
  - `POST /upload?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>` â€” Upload a file for an authenticated client
  - `GET /download?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>&width=<WIDTH>` â€” Serve stored files directly
    - optional parameters `width` & `height` trigger a server side resize of an image fetched.
    - if only one of them is set, then the image keeps the original aspect ratio.
  - `DELETE /upload?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>` â€” Delete a file
  - all requests except for `/download` require `x-api-key` to be set. 
- **Client isolation** â€” Each client has its own directory
- **API key authentication** â€” Verify requests using `client_id` and `api_key`
- **Allowed Origin control** â€” Per-client CORS restriction
- **SQLite database** â€” Stores `client_id`, `api_key`, and `allowed_origin`
- **Server Port** â€” Set the environment variable `HANDRADI_PORT` to your desired port, default is `8888`.

### CLI
Manage the serverâ€™s SQLite user database from the command line:
- `cli add <client_id> <api_key> <allowed_origin>` â€” Create a new client
- `cli list` â€” View all registered clients
- `cli delete <client_id>` â€” Delete a client (clients files are not deleted)
