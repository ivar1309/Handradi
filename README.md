## âœ¨ Features

### Server
- **HTTP-based file storage API**
  - `POST /upload?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>` â€” Upload a file for an authenticated client
  - `GET /download?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>&width=<WIDTH>` â€” Serve stored files directly
    - optional parameters `width` & `height` trigger a server side resize of an image fetched.
    - if only one of them is set, then the image keeps the original aspect ratio.
  - `DELETE /upload?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>` â€” Delete a file
  - `GET /presignurl?client=<ID>&filename=<NAME>` â€” Obtain a presigned upload url.
  - `POST /presignedupload?q=<BASE64ENCODED>` â€” Upload a file with presigned url
  - all requests except for `/download` and `/presignedupload` require `x-api-key` to be set.
  - `POST` methods require file content in the body of the request. 
- **Client isolation** â€” Each client has its own directory
- **API key authentication** â€” Verify requests using `client_id` and `api_key`
- **Allowed Origin control** â€” Per-client CORS restriction
- **SQLite database** â€” Stores `client_id`, `api_key`, and `allowed_origin`
- **Server Port** â€” Set the environment variable `HANDRADI_PORT` to your desired port, default is `8888`.
- **Presign Secret** â€” Set the environment variable `PRESIGN_SECRET` to a secure value.

### CLI
Manage the serverâ€™s SQLite user database from the command line:
- `cli add <client_id> <api_key> <allowed_origin>` â€” Create a new client
- `cli list` â€” View all registered clients
- `cli delete <client_id>` â€” Delete a client (clients files are not deleted)
